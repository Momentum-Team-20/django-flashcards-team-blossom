Skills Practiced: 
- Writing views, urls, and templates
- writing models and forms
- debugging in the shell
- Adding javaScript and CSS to the django project

Key Takeaways: 
- Giving the url in the template all the correct info it needs for the view to render properly (ie deck.pk)
- This project really solidified for me the relationship of templates, views, and urls. 
- Using QuerySets to pull objects out of the database

Challenges: 
- There are a lot of pieces that go into the whole thing really, but particularly into views that has been challenging to keep up with. Breaking things down as much as possible helps to know what to pass to the view and write in the view context. 

# Roadmap

- Saving data for correct/incorrect answers so that a correct card does not reappear in the deck and an incorrect card will appear again
- Restart the deck to include all cards
- Be able to search decks
- User could share decks with another specific user to study together
- User can organize decks according to subject, alphabetically, etc.
- Styling
    - centering text inside flash cards
    - arranging flashcard on viewpage
    - a celebration after user correctly answers all the cards (confetti or fun gif)
